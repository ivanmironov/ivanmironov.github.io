This is the documentation on my car alarm recognition project. We will be using ffmpeg to record the car alarm sounds, and then running that recording through a high-
and low-pass filter.

First, install open Termina and install ffmpeg by typing in the following command (this pressuposes you have homebrew installed):

```bash
brew install ffmpeg
```

Audio recording is done by typing in the following command:
```bash
ffmpeg -f avfoundation -i ":0" -t 10 ~/Desktop/piano-01.mp3 
```
High- and low-pass filters:
```bash
ffmpeg -i ~/Desktop/piano-01.mp3 -af "highpass=f=200, lowpass=f=3000" ~/Desktop/piano-03.mp3
```
The file is actually too large for my use case, so we compress it to a mono (versus a stereo) file:
```bash
ffmpeg -i ~/Desktop/piano-06.wav -acodec pcm_s16le -ac 1 -ar 16000 ~/Desktop/piano-07.wav
```
