*This is the documentation on my car alarm recognition project. This is a work in progress - I have started working on this in November 2020, and am adding changes to the blog post and the Python script as they come. The latest edit was on **Nov 22, 2020**.*

First, we need to actually grab the car alarm sounds when a horn outside starts blaring. For that, we will be using ffmpeg to record the car alarm, and then running that recording through a high- and low-pass filters.

First, install open Terminal and install ffmpeg by typing in the following command (this pressuposes you have homebrew installed):

```bash
brew install ffmpeg
```

Audio recording is done by typing in the following command:
```bash
ffmpeg -f avfoundation -i ":0" -t 10 ~/Desktop/piano-01.mp3 
```
High- and low-pass filters:
```bash
ffmpeg -i ~/Desktop/piano-01.mp3 -af "highpass=f=200, lowpass=f=3000" ~/Desktop/piano-03.mp3
```
The file is actually too large for my use case, so we compress it to a mono (versus a stereo) file:
```bash
ffmpeg -i ~/Desktop/piano-06.wav -acodec pcm_s16le -ac 1 -ar 16000 ~/Desktop/piano-07.wav
```
We will be using this Python script to actually analyze the gathered data. Brace yourselves, this will be somewhat long:

```python
import numpy as np
import wave
import struct

def find_nearest(array,value):
    idx = (np.abs(array-value)).argmin()
    return array[idx]

```

The code above is shamelessly based on the Python script from the following repository (thanks, @AyushKaul!): https://github.com/AyushKaul/Musical-Note-detection/blob/master/Audio_Processing.py

### to-do list: 
- Create a program to combine the ffmpeg recording process and the Python script
- Check the silence threshold and the code for detecting silent blocks between the honks
